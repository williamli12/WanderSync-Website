            <h2>Project Outcomes</h2>
            <p>Each person in the group contributed significantly to the project with our group cycling through the roles, allowing a different person each sprint to be the scrum master, so that we could mix up the teams while working on the code and diagram portions. If any group needed assistance, we were willing to participate and offer support, while continuing to meet the deadline. We also had consistent check-ins to make sure that each person was doing their part and had their tasks under control.</p>
            <h2>Challenges Encountered</h2>
            <p>At first we did experience setbacks due to poor time management and planning, which led to us having to work last minute on the sprints. In addition, we did not distribute the work properly, resulting in pairs not being able to start their work until another pair had finished theirs, causing delays in planning. However, once we realize the core of these problems, we set up the tasks in better order, allowing each pair to work without the need to depend on another pairâ€™s part. We also started working earlier on the project to ensure the completion of the task before the deadline, so that we had time to review.</p>
            <h2>Knowledge Gained</h2>
            <p>Throughout the development process, there were challenges that we had to undergo as documented above; however, from those challengers we learned how to better manage our team and workload to optimize how we were developing the program. We all learned the importance of dependency and communication to foster a well organized environment that would not drag others down.</p>
