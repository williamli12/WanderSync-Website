            <h2>Welcome to WanderSync</h2>
            <p>The project, “WanderSync: A Collaborative Travel Management System,” is a compact, organized application with the purpose to make the planning for trips more simplified and straightforward for the user. The app combines hotel reservations, flight planning, and transportation options to allow all these bookings to be handled in one app without the complications of having to use other websites or platforms to make these reservations. In addition, the application has the ability to work either solo or with a group, so that a group of invited users are able to see the other reservations and plans made by other individuals in the group. In addition, notes can be made on the app as well to alert the other groupmates about any potential changes or issues that want to be brought up. This app is created by Team 11 of CS2340 Section D.</p>
